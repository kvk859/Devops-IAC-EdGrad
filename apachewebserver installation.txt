1. Login to Ansible machine. Create SSH keys in Ansible host machine by executing the below command:

ssh-keygen
2. Copy the public keys(id_rsa.pub) from ansible node each node in /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys file. Execute the below command on Ansible and copy the content:
 sudo cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


3. Now login to target node, execute the below command to open the file
sudo vi /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys
type shift A and then enter. now 
    and paste the key in the above file. please do not delete any existing keys.

4. go back to ansible mgmt node, make sure you are able to ssh from ansible mgmt node after copying the keys above:
ssh private_ip_of_target_node
now type exit to come out of the target node.

5. Now in ansible mgmt node, now make changes in /etc/ansible/hosts file to include the node you will be installing software. Make sure you add public IP address as highlighted below in green color:
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[localhost]  
XX.XX.XX.XX ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

6. make changes in playbooks as given below,
cd ~/playbooks

sudo vi installApache.xml
Copy the below content

---
- hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install apcahe
      dnf:
       name=httpd
